SymScan
=======

**SymScan** enables extremely fast discovery of pairs of similar strings within
and across large collections. It is available as a :doc:`Rust library <rust>`,
a :doc:`CLI tool <cli>`, and a :doc:`Python package <py>`.

SymScan is a variation on the `symmetric deletion
<https://seekstorm.com/blog/1000x-spelling-correction/>`_ algorithm that is
optimised for bulk-searching similar strings within one or across two large
string collections at once (e.g. searching for similar protein sequences among
a collection of 10M). The key algorithmic difference between SymScan and
traditional symmetric deletion is the use of a `sort-merge join
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort-merge_join>`_ approach in place of hash
maps to discover input strings that share common deletion variants. This
sort-and-scan approach trades off an additional factor of O(log N) (with N the
total number of strings being compared) in expected time complexity for
improved cache locality and effective parallelization, and ends up being much
faster for the above use case.
